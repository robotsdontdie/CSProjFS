# CSProjFS

CSProjFS is a reimplementation of [Microsoft's managed ProjFS wrapper](https://github.com/microsoft/ProjFS-Managed-API) but written purely in C#.

The public API, along with any docstrings, are intended to match the original. The underlying behavior is fairly close, though this implementation
does not support the beta version of ProjFS.
